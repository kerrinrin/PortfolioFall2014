        <h1>How might technology be utilized to encourage consumers to waste less food in their households? </h1>
        <p>
     My senior year is currently under way, and a great deal of my time is dedicated to my thesis. The topic I've chosen to explore is the gargantuan problem of food waste here in the US. When nearly 40% of America's food supply goes to waste while over 1 billion people go hungry each day globally, this problem is desparate for solutions. Food waste is a multi-faceted problem with a myriad of possible approaches, so I began the process with an open mind, confident that taking a human-centered approach would guide me to a solution. <em>I'm only a few months into the process, so check back as I continue to update my progress! </em>

          <p>
              
              
The first step of the process was to figure out a target audience for my solution. Food waste in America happens at a variety of levels, spanning farming, post-harvest, packing, processing, transporation and distribution, retail, food service, and households. I decided to develop a solution aimed at consumers and their households. This was the group I would be able to reach most easily, and as food ultimately ends up on the plates of consumers, sparking change here has the potential for impact continuing up the "food chain" as a result.

                  <h1>Secondary Research</h1>
        <p>
  According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Wasteland-America-Throws-Nearly/dp/0738215287">American Wasteland by Jonathan Bloom</a>, consumers end up wasting an average of 25% of the food they buy. And According to <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0127881&representation=PDF">Wasted Food: U.S. Consumers' Reported Awareness, Attitudes, and Behaviors</a>, a report published by Johns Hopkins in spring of 2015, consumers self-report a relatively high awareness of and interest in preventing food waste, but their behaviors don't align with what they say. American consumers typically over report awareness and understanding of how to reduce food waste and under report their own waste. In terms of motivation to reduce food waste, saving money was at the top of the list, while environmental concerns ranked the lowest. From this research I learned that <em>the solution would have to focus on cost saving factors rather than environmental motivation or "guilt" factors, and that the solution should encourage education on how to reduce without being overimposing.</em>

               <h1>Primary Research</h1>
          <p>
              
              Next I went out and talked to some consumers. The interviewees were split into four groups: cost conscious families, environmentally conscious families, individuals in shared living situations, and households without kids. Talking to consumers confirmed some of the secondary research related to financials: saving money is a huge priority and was always valued over environmental consciousness. For example, multiple participants said they would often buy portions sizes that ended up being too big to finish because it ostensibly provided more value. Another commonly reported reason for wasting food was because it was forgotten about and spoiled before it could be used. Households with families and shared living spaces were especially prone to this issue because of their busy lifestyles.

        <h1>Insights </h1>
        <p> After talking to a number of different families and homeowners, I went back through my research notes and organized by observations, pain points, inferences, and opportunities. Then I mapped these notes by affinity, along the way uncovering several underlying themes and insights that were common amongst those interviewed. <em>Even the most environmetally conscious people waste, and people rarely feel personal responsibility or guilt for wasted or spoiled food, it just happens. Nearly ever participant admitted they had trouble keeping track of what food they have and when to use it by. Technology was not a first choice because often it was obtrusive and tedious to upkeep. And most participants were only partially knowledgeable on steps they could take to prevent food waste.</em>

               <h1>Solution...in progress</h1>
          <p>
              
              Based on my research, I ideated and came up with a few possible paths of action. <em>The idea I've decided to explore further is creating a method for keeping track of food so that it would not be forgotten.</em> I prototyped a variety of different ideas stemming from this concept and I'm now exploring the possibility of a "smart shopping list" that synchronizes all members of a household on what needs to be bought and what is currently available. The solution should also implicitly encourage consumers to be less wasteful and eat the most perishable ingridients first.
