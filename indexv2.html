        <p>My name is Kerrin, and I’m a designer, developer, innovator, and a changemaker.</p>  <p>Currently I’m completing my senior year studying Interactive Multimedia and Graphic Design at The College of New Jersey. </p>

<p>My main focus of study and work now centers around interaction design and development in the social innovation spectrum - I want to work for and with people who center their services around solving social issues in our world.</p>

<p>Put simply, I like helping people. I like solving problems with technology. It would be infinitely rewarding for me to do that for a living. I’m currently looking for opportunities starting Summer of 2016.</p>

           <b>Challenge</b>
            <p>When brought on to the design team at Ashoka for the summer of 2015, my task was to redesign how visitors to Ashoka.org engaged with the organization. Ashoka serves a vast network of people and finding the right direction was not an easy task on their current site. Extending "engagement", the Ashoka team also asked me to explore how the process of being hired to work at Ashoka could become more service design centered, and easier for both hirers and their hirees.</p>

           <b>Challenge</b>
            <p>Trenton is the state capital of New Jersey, but the city has been struggling in the past few decades. The College of New Jersey, where I am completing my undergrad, is in close proximity to the city. So some of the school's motivated design students like myself have made it our mission to use the school's resources and our knowledge of technology and design to help address some of the city's pressing problems. Trenton is seen as a 9-5 city. After the business men and women finish their days in the capital building, the city becomes quiet and desolate. There are many misconceptions that the city is run down and no longer a place worth visiting. How can we change that?  </p>

         <b>Insights</b>
            <p>When entering Trenton you will undoubtedly past a large bridge over the Delaware River with gleaming words that read, "Trenton Makes, The World Takes". Ask any outsider what Trenton makes, exactly, and they'll have no clue. The phrase is a nod to when Trenton used to be an industrial powerhouse on the East coast, but even though that era has past, it is clear from talking to Trenton residents that the city is still "making", just in a different way. </p>

         <b>Solution</b>
            <p>My team sought to show that Trenton and its residents are still making...making beautiful art, delicious restuarants, lively businesses, and so much more. We created the Trenton Makes Campaign to showcase the wonderful people still living and making in Trenton. I eventually transformed the orginal prototype to a custom wordpress theme. The project has since prompted a collaboration between the Interactive Mulitmedia and Journalism departments to document stories and has even become the centerpoint for a TCNJ class.</p>
