        <h1>The Missing Feature</h1>
        <p>
                For myself as well as many others on medication, remembering to take your medicines each day at the right time is really important, so I've used Mango Health in the past. I recently switched to a new medicine, and in addition to taking my medicine at the same time each day, I needed to pay close attention to how I felt each day so I could report back to my doctor in a few weeks. Thousands of other people go through this same experience. On Mango Health's website they allude to a tracking feature, but it was no where to be found. My answer to the KPCB design challenge was to imagine this feature as part of Mango Health.

          <p>
              
              
    I created a medium fidelity mockup to exhibit how I think the new symptom tracking feature would work. I created a quick visual representation in the wireframes similar Mango Health's actual design to show consistanctly without distracting too much from what I was trying to show. To the right is the option users would have available to them to track their symptoms when adding a new medication. Similar to the reminder option, the user can set a time where they will be prompted to track how the medicine is making them feel.

            The symptom check-in would begin with three simple options, do you feel good, bad, or the same? If the user taps either the good or bad feelings, they will be prompted to choose from symptoms commonly associated with that medicine type. Mango Health already has access to all of this data as seen in the medication alerts that are available with each medication the user adds. The user also has the option to input custom symptoms under "Other" if they don't see what they're looking for. Once they've entered the symptoms for say, positive feelings, there's the option to go back and enter negative symptoms as well. 
            
            </p>
        
        
        </div></section>
          
          <section class="row"><div class="grid-5 vert-top">
             
             
          <p>
              
              
 Once the user has entered their symptoms for the day, the corresponding icons will be added to the schedule, giving this feature added functionality by providing a quick way to look back and see how you were feeling on a given day. Lastly, a new tab is added to the medicine's information page, the log. The log will short your most common symptoms and how the user has felt from week to week. <em>The purpose of this feature is to make communicating with one's doctor a lot easier. When the user returns to the doctor's office to report on how they've been doing, rather than struggling to remember the details, they'll be able to confidently respond. "Well, my most common symptom is dizziness, but my mood has improved a lot. In week one and two I had headaches but they disapeered in week three".
